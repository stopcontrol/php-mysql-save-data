A set of PHP / JS functions for helping jsPsych communicate with a MySQL database. These scripts allow you to:

1. Check if a subject has already started the experiment in a previous session.
2. Assign the subject to a condition in a (somewhat) balanced manner.
3. Save data to a MySQL database.

There are three PHP scripts, one for each of the above tasks, plus a PHP config file.

The JS file is a client side library for communicating with the PHP.

### MySQL Tables

The PHP file expects three tables to be in the database.

`$table_exclude` needs to have the columns `row`, `workerID`, and `completionCode`.
`row` should be an auto incrementing primary key.
`workerID` is the unique ID associated with your subject, e.g., a Mechanical Turk workerID.
`completionCode` is a randomly generated set of letters that you can use as a survey completion code that is unique to that subject, if desired.

`$table_condition` needs to have the columns `row`, `subjectID`, and `assignedCondition`.
`row` should be an auto incrementing primary key.
`subjectID` is an ID that you generate, e.g., using `jsPsych.randomization.randomID()`. You can use a Mechanical Turk workerID, but be aware that such IDs are *not* anonymous and that this could potentially create confidentiality problems.
`assignedCondition` will be an integer, generated by the server, indicating the condition assignment. If you have a design with multiple factors, then you need to convert this single integer to the appropriate level for each cell. For example, in a 2x2 design, assignedCondition could be 0, 1, 2, or 3. You should convert these 4 values to the 4 different cells in the 2x2.

`$table_data` needs to have a column for each variable that you want to save from your jsPsych experiment. You can run the command `jsPsych.data.get().uniqueNames()` *after the experiment has completed* to get a list of all the different variables that jsPsych is capturing in your experiment.
